# Statistical inference for linear regression models


This unit introduces statistical inference for **singleâ€‘predictor linear regression**. Building on the examples from last week, we will learn about **estimators** and their properties, such as **standard errors** and **confidence intervals**. We will then apply these concepts to linear regression modeling, deriving an unbiased estimator of the regression slope and understanding how **hypothesis tests** work for single-predictor regression models. Regression to the mean will also be covered.

# Concepts
Estimators, bias and consistency, Linear regression (single predictor) model and assumptions, Covariance, correlation and their relationship to regression slope. Regression to the mean.  Least squares interpretation of covariance formula. Hypothesis testing for regression models. 


# Things to practice
- Identify whether a simple estimator is biased or not, by hand if possible, or using simulations in Python.  
- Use the CLT to approximate the sample distribution of an estimator. 
- Stating the assumptions of a linear regression model and identify (e.g. based on plots) when they are invalid. 
- Be able to relate regression paramaters and means and variance of the predictor to the marginals. 
- Understand the relationship between model paramaters, correlations, coefficient of determination. Know the meaning of correlations and cod. 
- Interpret the output of a fitted linear regression model and access the goodness of fit (coefficient of determination).
