# Expectation, Continuous probability, CLT and Normal models

In this section we introduce **expectation**, an operation which takes a random variable and produces a deterministic quantity. The expectation of a random variable can be approximated with **sample averages**, and from them we can infer properties of the model (like parameters). Much of statistics relies on the fact that sample averages approximate expectations, and understanding how well these approximations work is a central goal of statistics. This will motivate us to study the probability distribution of sums of random variables, which leads to the **CLT** and the **Normal distribution**. We will also learn about **log-normal distributions**, which are a better model for many real-world random variables, but can easily be mapped to normal random variables. By defining joint distribution where the conditionals are Normal, we will arrive at our first example of a **linear regression** model.

# Concepts

Expectation, conditional expectation, empirical averages, CLT, Normal random variables and their properties, coefficient of variation, mean vs. median, log normal (if time permits).

# Things to practice

- Calculate expectations by hand and in Python (including conditional expectations).
- Manipulate normal random variables  (apply linearity of expectation and independence to simplify calculations.)
- How to use CLT to estimate probabilities of sums (and know when the CLT gives an accurate approximation)
- Determine if the Normal model is a good model from data based on quantiles.
